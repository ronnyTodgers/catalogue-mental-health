    "term": "Accelerated cohort study",
    "definition": "Unlike cohort studies that follow one group of people of the same age over time, these studies track several groups, each starting at different ages. This way, researchers can learn about a wide age range faster than just watching one group grow older. However, a downside is that not all information will be available at every age in each group."

This approach helps to understand how trends or conditions in the general population change over time, although it doesn't track the changes in specific individuals. For example, the European Social Survey, conducted every two years, interviews fresh samples from over 20 European countries, allowing analysis of behaviours and changes across society. These studies are particularly useful for examining changes in the population across different \"waves\" of a study, even though they don't focus on individual changes."

    "definition": "Research in which data about people is analysed. Although this might be participatory research (the researchers meet people and collect data from them specifically for the study), this kind of research often uses routinely collected data from large numbers of people (i.e. from contacts with GPs). Using information from a very large number of people often makes the research better able to find answers. However, conclusions from routinely collected data are tentative, because â€œcorrelation does not imply causationâ€. If event A is associated (correlated) with event B, is that because A causes B, because B causes A, because X causes both A and B, or was it a chance finding? Strong conclusions may require randomised controlled trials."

    "term": "Informed Consent",
    "definition": "â€œInformed Consentâ€ is when people are asked to be part of something, whether it's an official research study or not. When someone wants you to be involved in something, they should tell you everything you need to know about itâ€\"what's going on, what could go right or wrong, and what will happen to the information you share. This helps you decide if you want to join in or not, based on having all the facts.<br>\n<br>\nThis can extend to situations where people collaborate to understand and tackle problems, even if they aren't following a strict research study format. And \"Informed Consent\" is still important in these situations to make sure everyone knows what they're getting into and can make their own choices.<br>\n<br>\nNormally, medical research studies where people take part (â€˜<a href=\"#Participatory Research\">participatory research</a>') may only involve those who consent. Informed consent here is an internationally agreed ethical principle of <a href=\"#Participatory Research\">participatory research</a>. â€œInformedâ€ means that before deciding, the person should understand all relevant aspects of the study, including its aims and potential risks and benefits<br>\n<br>\nConsent might not always be necessary in non-participatory epidemiological research that uses anonymised, routinely collected data. This kind of research doesn't require direct participation from people, as researchers work with data that has already been gathered. If it's ensured that nobody can be identified from the research, consent might not be needed. It's important to know that consent can change over time. People can decide to stop participating in research whenever they want, and they won't be treated badly for it. This highlights how vital it is for researchers to keep talking with participants openly. This way, participants can freely decide what's best for them and feel like their choices matter."

    "term": "Mental Capacity",
    "definition": "The ability of a person to make an informed decision. In the UK, the law sets out what this means. Research involving people whose mental capacity is impaired has to follow special rules to keep participants safe. People's ability to understand things can change based on their health and situation. When they agree to something, it's important to check if they understand because this can sometimes be tricky to figure out. That's why it's necessary to assess their understanding right when they agree."

For example, when it comes to using their anonymous health data for research, if people don't actively opt out, their data will be included. So it's about people having to take action to be \"<a href=\"<#National\" data=\"\" opt-out=\"\" (ndo)=\"\">out</a>\" and exclude themselves."

This kind of research usually involves meeting with researchers, and providing information or undergoing tests like questionnaires or brain scans. It can even include testing new treatments. In these studies, only those who agree to join are included. This is part of participatory research, and it's important that everyone knows all about it. This is where \"<a href=\"#Informed Consent\">Informed Consent</a>\" comes in. Informed consent is a big rule in participatory research. It means before someone says yes to joining a study, they need to understand everything important about it, like what the study wants to find out and what could be good or bad about it. Informed consent makes sure people decide with full knowledge.<br>\n<br>\nSometimes, people who can't make decisions for themselves might be part of participatory research. But this only happens if the study is about the condition that makes it hard for them to decide, like dementia. This way, they can still be part of research that fits their situation."

In contrast to research â€œtoâ€, â€œaboutâ€ or â€œforâ€ them. This is very different to participation in research.<br>\n<br>\nPatient and Public Involvement (PPI) means that people who have personal experience of a specific condition or situation are included in the planning, conduct, and application of research studies. They have a say in how the research is designed and carried out, ensuring that it meets their needs and is more relevant to their real-life experiences. By involving patients and the public, research becomes more focused on what matters to them, leading to better outcomes and benefits for everyone involved. <br>\n<br>\nTo ensure patients and the public have a direct voice in the running and direction of DATAMIND, a Super Research Advisory Group (SRAG) was created. It is composed of people from various backgrounds, including service users and carers from across the UK, who have an interest in data.

They may suggest changes before recommending publication, or they may advise against publishing.

    "term": "Measures",
    "definition": "In any study, we need to decide what we are measuring and how. For example, we might measure waist circumference to assess obesity or use a heart rate monitor to track fitness. These are the <a href=\"#Measures\">measures</a> we are interested in, and it's important that everyone in the study uses the same methods to ensure consistent and unbiased results."

    "term": "Phenotype data",
    "definition": "Information about an organism's traits, like height, eye color, or mental health. For example, phenotype data is used to study how certain traits are inherited or could be used to personalise treatments."
  },
  "term_72": {
    "term": "Genetic Conditions",
    "definition": "Conditions caused by changes in a person's <a href=\"#DNA\">DNA</a>, which can be inherited from parents or occur spontaneously. These conditions often affect how the body grows or functions. For example, genetic conditions, like cystic fibrosis, are studied to understand how inherited traits impact health and to develop treatments."

  "term_73": {
    "term": "DNA",
    "definition": "DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid is&nbsp;a molecule, present in all our cells, that contains the genetic code that is unique to every individual. Think of this code as an instruction manual for making all the proteins that form our bodies and help them thrive. The information coded in DNA is hereditary, meaning that it passes from parent to child. DNA testing is often used in research to study genetic conditions or ancestry. See <strong>genes</strong>."

  "term_74": {
    "term": "Bias",
    "definition": "An unfair influence or distortion that can affect the accuracy of study results or decisions. Bias can happen at various stages of research, including study design, data collection, or analysis. It can make results less reliable or applicable to certain groups of people. For example, if a study only includes young participants, it might create bias because the results may not apply to older people. This could lead to treatments or findings that are less effective or safe for older populations. Bias can also occur in how questions are asked, how data is analysed, or even in how results are interpreted. Researchers work to minimise bias to ensure the study is fair and results are accurate for everyone involved."

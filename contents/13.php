                <p>The Catalogue does not provide access to data. Each study in the Catalogue has data access policies
                    and procedures. Some studies have their data available to download from their study site or the <a
                        href="https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/">UK Data Service</a>. To learn more about accessing a study’s
                    data, head to the ‘Data Access’ section of their study page.</p>
                <p>It is important to remember that the studies you see on the Catalogue may be in the process of
                    collecting data and therefore may not be ready to share yet. We keep the Catalogue as up to date as
                    possible by including the mental health measures used at the most recent sweeps, including sweeps
                    where the data has not yet been released.</p>

                <p>If your initial search doesn&rsquo;t get any results &ndash; don&rsquo;t worry! We have some top tips
                    to find exactly what you are looking for.</p>
                <p>First, it is good to try changing the terminology you use in your search or try using synonyms,
                    especially if you are looking for a topic that may be less commonly measured. For example, if you
                    are looking for binge eating disorder, it is better to search for the disorder itself, rather than
                    specific symptoms, such as &lsquo;vomiting&rsquo; or &lsquo;over-eating&rsquo;. Using different
                    terminology will improve your search.</p>
                <p>To find the most accurate terminology, we recommend checking the list of mental health topics covered
                    by the Catalogue. These are located under the &lsquo;<a href="?content=6">mental health and
                        wellbeing
                        topics</a>&rsquo; page. It is a good idea to check here if the disorder you are looking for is
                    covered in the Catalogue before you search for it.</p>
                <p>The search engine will only allow you to look for mental health and wellbeing topics, instruments, or
                    studies. If you are looking for related topics, you can use the filters.</p>
                <p>If you need help, or still can&rsquo;t find what you&rsquo;re looking for, contact us at <a

                <p>The Catalogue provides detail on standard and non-standard (bespoke) measures, so there are many
                    options to consider for research. Both standard instruments, such as the Strength and Difficulties

                <p>The Catalogue serves as a resource to give a wide view of the data already collected, maintaining a
                    focus on mental health and wellbeing. Within this context, the Catalogue includes measures of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indicators of mental health problems, including symptoms, behaviours, and reports of diagnoses

                    <li>Measures of Personality and temperament</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To cover all bases, the Catalogue includes standard and non-standard measures, but these must be
                    specific to mental health and wellbeing only. Furthermore, maintaining this focus, the Catalogue
                    does not include measures of neurocognitive disorders, cognition, or risk factors.</p>
                <p>However, while we don&rsquo;t include detailed information about biological or social risk factors of
                    mental health measured in studies, we note these when reviewing the studies. This information can be
                    found using the &lsquo;related measures&rsquo; filter on the search page, and includes topics such
                    as loneliness and social isolation, migration and immigration, and sleep problems.</p>
                <p>Criteria for study inclusion in the Catalogue does not just depend on measures of mental health. Head

                <p>Longitudinal research means that data is repeatedly collected over a time frame. There are multiple
                    designs or types of longitudinal studies, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cohort studies &ndash; Following the same group of people that share a characteristic over a
                        given period. A cohort could be a group born around the same time, share a diagnosis, or have
                        experienced the same life event. For example, the <a href="?content=study&studyid=ELSA">English
                            Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA)</a>.</li>
                    <li>Household panel surveys &ndash; Data is collected repeatedly from the same household, not
                        necessarily the same people. An example of this study design is <a
                            href="?content=study&studyid=UKHLS">Understanding
                            Society</a>.</li>
                    <li>Repeated cross-sectional studies &ndash; These studies collect data from different samples at
                        each time point. This new recruitment at each wave ensures a representative sample of the
                        population. Studies with this design cannot be used to look at individuals over time but can
                        look at changes in populations. The <a href="?content=study&studyid=APMS">Adult
                            Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS)</a> is an example of this design.</li>
                    <li>Accelerated cohort studies &ndash; Accelerated cohort studies follow the same design as cohort
                        studies but recruit multiple cohorts of different ages at the start of the study. An example of
                        this study design is the <a href="?content=stud&studyid=WOS">West of
                            Scotland</a></li>
                    <li>Linked cohort studies &ndash; A linked cohort is created when data is collected from multiple
                        sources of routinely collected data, such as medical records or education records. This type of
                        cohort is used in <a href="?content=study&studyid=SEP-MD">SEP-MD</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>A cohort with linked data combines primary and secondary data. For example, <strong>Born
                    </strong>i<strong>n Bradford</strong> links education records, healthcare, and environmental data to
                    their cohort information. In contrast, a linked cohort uses secondary data, such as healthcare or
                    education records, to create a dataset. An example of this is the <strong>SEP-MD </strong>study. In
                    a data linkage study, the cohort is called a &lsquo;linked cohort&rsquo;.</p>

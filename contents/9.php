            <p>The Learning Hub is an online teaching resource has been produced by CLOSER to<strong> introduce
                    longitudinal studies to non-experts</strong> in both academic and policy settings. The Learning Hub
                has information and resources to help you explore longitudinal studies and get started using the data.
                As you progress through the different sections of the site, you can test their knowledge using
                interactive quizzes.</p>
            <p>Topics covered include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introduction to longitudinal research:</strong>&nbsp;types of longitudinal studies and using

                increase our understanding of mental health and wellbeing is also available in the &lsquo;explore by
                topic&rsquo; section. Case studies of longitudinal research are also provided, covering the research

<p><a href="https://www.cmi.manchester.ac.uk/study/short/introductory/intro-to-longitudinal-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Introduction to Longitudinal Data Analysis<br /></strong></a><strong>University of Manchester</strong><em><br /></em>Duration: 1 day&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course covers basic concepts in longitudinal design and analysis. The morning session focuses on the strengths and methodological difficulties of the longitudinal approach such as defining longitudinal populations and target samples; levels and dimensions of change; age, period and cohort effects.

<p>By the end of the course, students should have gained:</p>
<ul>
<li>An understanding of the different ways of measuring and explaining change using longitudinal data</li>
<li>An appreciation of the particular problems posed by missing data in longitudinal research</li>
<li>A basic understanding of ways of adjusting for missing data</li>

<p><a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/biostatisticshealthinformatics/teaching/courses/multilevel-and-longitudinal-modelling" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Multilevel and Longitudinal Modelling<br /></strong></a><strong>King&rsquo;s College London, Institute of Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience</strong><em><br /></em>Duration: 4 days</p>
<p>As health care data becomes more complex and multimodal, the structure of the data becomes increasingly complicated. There could be an increasing number of repeated measurements on the same individuals over time, longer duration of follow-up for time-to-event outcomes or nested hierarchies leading to non-independence of individuals. The use of simpler statistical approaches to analyse these data is invalid because the key assumptions of those approaches do not hold. In this module, we introduce the concept of multilevel and longitudinal modelling, including time-to-event or survival analysis.</p>
<p>The aim is for the student to understand the challenges of longitudinal and clustered data, and the concept and implementation of multilevel models. Students will also become familiar with the most common models for time-to-event data (including Cox proportional hazard models, additive hazard models), and finally link all these concepts together through joint modelling of survival and longitudinal data.</p>
<p>This workshop will assume that participants have a good knowledge of basic regression and statistical modelling and any syntax based statistical software, such as STATA.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncrm.ac.uk/training/show.php?article=9667" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Analysing Longitudinal Data: Using Latent Variable Models to Assess Change<br /></strong></a><strong>Ulster University<em><br /></em></strong>Duration: 2 days</p>
<p>The analysis of change is central to much psychological and social research. Latent Growth Models (LGM) are an important class of models for the assessment of change. In essence these describe individuals&rsquo; behaviour in terms of an initial starting point and their subsequent developmental trajectories. The technique also allows for the introduction of predictors of change. Growth mixture models (GMMs) will also be introduced. These models enable the researcher to explore longitudinal data for the presence of unobserved or latent subgroups and estimate latent growth parameters for each of the subgroups.</p>
<p>It is expected that participants will have some knowledge and understanding of Structural Equation Modelling. This workshop will use the Mplus programme.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncrm.ac.uk/training/show.php?article=8807" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Longitudinal and Missing Data<br /></strong></a><strong>Royal Statistical Society <br /></strong>Duration: 2 days</p>
<p>When analysing hierarchical and longitudinal data, one is often confronted with missing observations, i.e. scheduled measurements have not been made, due to a variety of (known or unknown) reasons. It will be shown that, if no appropriate measures are taken, missing data can seriously jeopardize results and interpretation difficulties are bound to occur. Methods to properly analyse incomplete data, under flexible assumptions, will be presented.</p>
<p>The course begins with a brief presentation of linear mixed models for continuous hierarchical data. Emphasis will be on model formulation, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, as well as the distinction between the random-effects (hierarchical) model and the implied marginal model. Models for non-Gaussian data will be discussed, with a strong emphasis on generalized estimating equations (GEE) and the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). A brief review of the classical generalized linear modelling framework will be presented. Similarities and differences to the continuous case will be discussed. The differences between marginal models (such as GEE) and random-effects models (such as the GLMM) will be explained in detail. Focus will be primarily on binary outcomes, however, GEE and GLMM model formulations will also be covered.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, it will be assumed that the participants are familiar with basic statistical modelling, including linear models (regression and analysis of variance), as well as generalized linear models (logistic and Poisson regression). Pre-requisite knowledge should also include general estimation and testing theory (maximum likelihood, likelihood ratio).</p>

<p>This course provides an introduction to methods for analysing longitudinal/repeated continuous data, with a focus on methods for analysing individual trajectories over time. Multilevel modelling and structural equation modelling (SEM) approaches will be described and compared.

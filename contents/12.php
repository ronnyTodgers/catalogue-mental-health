            <p><strong>DATAMIND, the Health Data Research UK Hub for Mental Health</strong></p>
            <p> DATAMIND, funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and collaborating with Health Data
                Research (HDR) UK and MQ: Transforming Mental Health, operates as a central hub for Mental
                Health Informatics Research. Led by Professors Ann John and Rob Stewart, DATAMIND
                collaborates extensively with partners across the UK, collecting anonymous mental health
                data from diverse sources to enhance understanding, help shape and inform policy decisions,
                and ultimately improve the lives of people living with poor mental health.
                <br><br>
                Empowering researchers and engaging with academics, the public, policymakers, the private
                sector, and charities, DATAMIND transforms how information is utilised. By connecting
                researchers with crucial data and involving those with personal mental health experiences,
                DATAMIND explores unconventional data sources and fosters innovative, secure data use. This
                inclusive approach spans all four nations of the UK, ensuring diverse perspectives are
                considered and collaboration is encouraged.
                <br><br>
                DATAMIND continuously organises UK data, focusing on mental health information, including
                gene studies, routine care, volunteer cohorts, and trials (often through the Catalogue of
                Mental Health Measures), as well as novel data from schools and charities. Researchers can
                access and use datasets through the HDR UK Innovation Gateway. The overall aim is to
                transform how mental health data in the UK is accessed and found and used.

                This work is guided by six main objectives:
            <ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>To embed patient, personal experience and public participation
                    <li>To be guided by and responsive to the needs of users
                    <li>To make data discoverable, accessible and available
                    <li>To curate and enhance the interoperability of data
                    <li>To develop global standards
                    <li>To support capacity development
                        <br>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            To achieve these objectives, DATAMIND has focused on four core activities:
            <ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Public Participation, Partnership and Governance
                    <li>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Curated Mental Health Data
                    <li>Workforce Capacity, Training and Development
                    <li>Business Development and Sustainability
                        <p>
            </ul>
            </ol>
            The Catalogue of Mental Health Measures and collaborators, such as the HDR UK Innovation
            Gateway, are part of the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Curated Mental
            Health Data core activity. All share similar values about the importance of making mental health
            data discoverable and encouraging the uptake of data to overall improve our understanding of
            mental health.

            <hr />
            <p><strong>DATAMIND Super Research Advisory Group (SRAG)</strong></p>
            <p>From the outset, DATAMIND agreed to “work with patients and people with personal experience
                of mental illness to understand whom they trust to use their data, and to develop ways
                people can work together on mental health.”</p>
            <p>As a result, the Super Research Advisory Group (SRAG) was developed by DATAMIND to engage
                with members of their communities and the general public. The SRAG comprises people with
                personal experiences of mental illness, whether personal or through caring for others.</p>
            <p>Some projects that the SRAG have worked on include:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing a user-friendly mental health DATAMIND glossary </li>
                <li>Creating a diagram for ‘Meaningful Involvement of Patients, Carers, and the Public in
                    Research’</li>
                <li>Supporting the simplification of genetic tables for patients and the public</li>
                <li>Sharing discovered insights at the MQ Data Science Conference</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The SRAG works closest with the projects of ‘Public Participation, Partnership and
                Governance’ but members of the SRAG are continuously contributing to other projects
                affiliated with DATAMIND as well.</p>

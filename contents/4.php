<h4>NEW STUDIES & COLLABORATIVE INITIATIVES ON MENTAL HEALTH & COVID-19</h4>
<p>
A number of new studies have been initiated to explore the effects of the pandemic on mental health, along with coordination efforts to facilitate collaboration between these studies.
</p>
<p>
<b>WELLCOME TRUST COVID-19 QUESTIONNAIRE</b><br>
The Wellcome Longitudinal Population Study (LPS) COVID-19 Steering Group & Secretariat has developed the <a href=“http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/wellcome-covid-19/” target = “_blank”>Wellcome Trust Covid-19 Questionnaire</a> to maximise the benefits gained from pandemic data collection by existing cohorts at minimal added cost and maximal public benefit.<br><br>
  The questionnaire is <b>freely available to all population health researchers</b> wishing to address health, behaviour, social, environmental and economic questions in the context of the pandemic. Find out more on the <a href =“http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/wellcome-covid-19/” target = “_blank”>questionnaire webpage</a>. Search <b>“Wellcome”</b> in the COVID timeline to identify data collection points that have utilised the CRISIS Survey.  
</p>
<p>
<b> NIH CORONAVIRUS HEALTH IMPACT (CRISIS) SURVEY</b><br>
The <a href ="http://www.crisissurvey.org/" target = "_blank">CRISIS Survey</a> is designed to enable researchers and care providers to examine the extent and impact of life changes induced by the epidemic on the mental health and behaviour of individuals and families across diverse international settings. The survey is available for download and use on the <a href =” http://www.crisissurvey.org/” target = “_blank”>CRISIS website</a>. Search <b>“crisis”</b> in the COVID timeline to identify data collection points that have utlitsed the CRISIS Survey.
</p>
<p>
<b>COVID MINDS</b><br>
    <a href="https://www.covidminds.org/" target = "_blank">COVID-MINDS</a> is a network of longitudinal studies on the global mental health impact of COVID-19 funded by the Wellcome Trust. COVID-MINDS aims to support data sharing, the harmonisation of mental health measures, and dissemination. The network have identified: 
    <ul>
        <li>New and established <b>longitudinal studies</b> examining mental health during COVID-19</li>
        <li>Studies based in the UK and <b>across the world</b></li>
     </ul>
     This <a href="https://www.covidminds.org/longitudinalstudies" target = "_blank">list of studies</a> is updated weekly to include all live studies and open access materials. If you run a relevant longitudinal study, you can register your study with the network. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>COVID-19 & MENTAL HEALTH STUDIES REGISTER</b><br>
The NIHR Mental Health Translational Research Collaboration (MH-TRC) have established the <a href = "https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/research/covid-19-studies/" target="_blank">COVID-19 and Mental Health Studies Register</a> with the aim of facilitating the development of high-quality collaborative mental health research in the context of the pandemic. The register collates information about:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Any study based in the UK</b> that either <b>addresses mental health</b> aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, or has the potential to address this field (for example, a COVID-19 respiratory study which is open to adding mental health outcome measures)</li>
        <li>International studies which have UK partners</li>
    </ul>
    Any studies which meet these criteria are invited to <a href = "https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/research/covid-19-studies/" target="_blank">register</a>, with the full list of registered list of studies available <a href = "https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/research/covid-19-studies-project-search/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<b>UK LONGITUDINAL LINKAGE COLLABORATION (LLC)</b><br>
The <a href="https://ukllc.ac.uk/" target = "_blank">UK LONGITUDINAL LINKAGE COLLABORATION</a> (UK LLC) is a new Trusted Research Environment (TRE) that hosts longitudinal study data, including mental health data, from more than 20 of the UK&rsquo;s established <a href="https://ukllc.ac.uk/partner-studies/" target = "_blank">longitudinal studies</a> that is linked to studies&rsquo; participants NHS health records. It is a unique four-nations infrastructure for secure cross-cohort analysis where researchers can apply to access linked data across all partner studies through a single application.<br><br>
The UK LLC TRE contains pre-pandemic longitudinal data and data collected from participants during the lockdowns and throughout the pandemic. ONS Approved Researchers working on COVID-19 research may apply to access this data, which is currently free of charge.

                    <p>Louise Arseneault&rsquo;s research focuses on the study of harmful behaviours such as violence
                        and substance dependence, their developmental origins, their inter-connections with mental
                        health and their consequences for victims. She is taking a developmental approach to investigate
                        how the consequences of violence begin in childhood and persist to mid-life, by studying
                        bullying victimisation and child maltreatment. Louise also studies the impact of social
                        relationships including social support, loneliness and social isolation on mental health. Her
                        research aims are to answer questions relevant to psychology and psychiatry by harnessing and
                        combining three different research approaches: developmental research, epidemiological methods
                        and genetically sensitive designs, incorporating social and biological measurements across the
                        lifespan.</p>
                    <p>Louise completed her PhD in biomedical sciences at the University of Montreal and moved to the UK
                        for post-doctoral training at the <a

                        intellectual leadership and strategic advice in the priority area of mental health. It was a
                        broad agenda including engaging research communities, promoting collaborations, advocating for
                        mental health research, championing the co-design and co-production of research and providing
                        advice to the ESRC and other research councils. She provided advice on how social science
                        research can best address the challenges that mental health poses for our society, communities
                        and individuals.</p>

                        using qualitative and quantitative methods. She joined the team in July 2018 to review the
                        mental health measures in British longitudinal studies and assist in the development of the
                        Catalogue. Before joining the project, she completed a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) at the

                    <p>Barbara Maughan&rsquo;s research focuses on psychosocial and biological risks for mental health
                        problems in childhood and the long-term impact of early emotional/behavioural difficulties and
                        early adverse experiences for health and wellbeing later in life. She has undertaken
                        epidemiological and longitudinal studies of a range of child and adolescent difficulties,
                        including conduct problems and antisocial behaviour, severe reading problems, and depression.
                        She has studied individual, family, school and broader societal risk factors. She uses a
                        combination of research strategies centring on epidemiological and longitudinal methods; she has
                        also used natural experimental designs to highlight the impact of environmental risks.</p>

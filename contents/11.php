        <div class="col-md-8 col-lg-10 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <p>Louise Arseneault’s research focuses on the study of harmful behaviours such as violence and substance dependence, their developmental origins, their inter-connections with mental health, and their consequences for victims. She is taking a developmental approach to investigate how the consequences of violence begin in childhood and persist to mid-life, by studying bullying victimisation and child maltreatment. Louise also studies the impact of social relationships including social support, loneliness and social isolation on mental health. Her research aims are to answer questions relevant to psychology and psychiatry by harnessing and combining three different research approaches: developmental research, epidemiological methods and genetically sensitive designs. Louise’s work incorporates social as well as biological measurements across the lifespan.</p>
        </p><p>Louise completed her PhD in biomedical sciences at the University of Montreal and moved to the UK for post-doctoral training at the Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre. She has been working with well-known longitudinal cohorts such as the Montreal Longitudinal Cohorts, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study and the National Child Development Survey (NCDS).
        </p><p>For five years, Louise was the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Mental Health Leadership Fellow. Louise’s role as a Fellow with the ESRC included providing intellectual leadership and strategic advice in the priority area of mental health. It was a broad agenda including engaging research communities, promoting collaborations, advocating for mental health research, championing the co-design and co-production of research and providing advice to the ESRC and other research councils. She provided advice on how social science research can best address the challenges that mental health poses for our society, communities and individuals. 
        </p><p>In 2022-2023, Louise led the Landscaping International Longitudinal Datasets project, funded by the Wellcome Trust and in collaboration with MQ Mental Health Research, the Open Data Institute, the Centre for Global Mental Health and Datamind. The Lanscaping project was a worldwide search for longitudinal datasets with potential for transformative mental health research.</p>

<div class="col-md-8 col-lg-10 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
<p>Barbara Maughan&rsquo;s research focuses on psychosocial and biological risks for mental health problems in childhood, and the long-term impact of early emotional/behavioural difficulties and early adverse experiences for health and well-being later in life. She has undertaken epidemiological and longitudinal studies of a range of child and adolescent difficulties including conduct problems and antisocial behaviour, severe reading problems, and depression, and has studied risk factors at the individual, family, school and broader societal levels. She uses a combination of research strategies centring on epidemiological and longitudinal methods; she has also used natural experimental designs to highlight the impact of environmental risks.</p>
<p>Barbara came into research from a background in social work; she completed her PhD while working at the Institute of Psychiatry and has since worked in both the MRC Child Psychiatry Unit and the Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre at King&rsquo;s College London. She has helped conduct the adult follow-up phases of epidemiological samples in inner London and the Isle of Wight and has also made extensive use of secondary analysis of data from the British birth cohort studies in conducting her research. She is currently Professor of Developmental Epidemiology at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King&rsquo;s College London.</p>
